# Project Euler in Rust

A workspace of [Project Euler]() solutions for user [ethan-arrowood]() written in Rust.

This is a learning exercise for better understanding the Rust programming language.

This repo is a workspace. Each directory maps to a single problem in Project Euler. 

Run code using `cargo run -p <package>`

`<package>` corresponds to entries within the `Cargo.toml` file which also maps directly to the names of the directories in this repo.
